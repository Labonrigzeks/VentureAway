					<h4 class="our-stories">Are's Trip to France</h4>
						<p class="our-stories"> My first trip was actually somewhat of a hassle, I managed to book the wrong tickets. Making all of France quake at my arrival, but 
						once I got there and found a place to put my bags, I settled very quickly. </p>
						<p class="our-stories"> I wanted to see the country of France, not just the cities and buildings. Even 
						though I saw alot of that too. At the start of my trip i went to Montreal, but after a week I drove to Bretange and, I believe, spent two weeks there, 
						swimming, sightseeing, and laughing at terrible french puns. </p>
						<p class="our-stories"> The time i spent there, away from the big cities was by far the best. Too many people forget 
						that Paris is a large and crowded city. </p>
						<p class="our-stories"> My tip to our readers would be: Go to the country side, stay away from the posh people of Paris. You need to dig 
						abit deeper to find the romance in France. They hide it well, but its there. </p>

					<h4 class="our-stories">Arvinn's Trip to Iran</h4>
						<p class="our-stories"> Iran is my homeland. My parents are from there and near to all my family lives there. Every other year in the summer i travel to 
						Iran. But, i dont travel only to visit family. Summer 2017, was the year i went sightseeing in Iran, in the country of Karaj. </p> 
						<p class="our-stories"> I went on a road trip with my uncle, seeing the parts of Iran that i have never seen. The wast deserty mountains was endless. It is 
						the complete opposite of grassy mountains. In the picture above my story, you can see the road we were taking. 35 degrees celcius, clear sky, it could not 
						be any better. I could not believe how much water there was, as Iran is not the country with most water. I could feel the water cooling me while we were on 
						the road. </p>
						<p class="our-stories"> Eventually, after a long road trip, we arrived at the cottage, that i would spend my time with my uncle for two weeks. It was the 
						best, just taking in the nature of Karaj. If you ever decide to go to Iran, be sure to go where there is no city, the country side. You will have a amazing 
						time, taking in the real charm of Iran. And i definitely recommend Karaj as there are many cottages to lend for weeks. </p>

					<h4 class="our-stories">Vinjar's Trip to Germany</h4>
						<p class="our-stories">Summer 2018 three friends and I went on a road trip, heading for Nürburgring, Germany, the famous Formula 1 race track. We had talked
						about it for years, and with a bit of planning we finally went and did it. The point was to drive there with my friends car, since they accept
						<a class="our-stories-text-link" href="http://www.nuerburgring.de/en/home.html">tourist drives on the Nürburgring website.</a> We drove through Norway from west to east, through Sweden
						and Denmark, and slept in Copenhagen for a few nights, so we could attend a public viewing of the football World Cup together with thousands of other people. </p>
						<p class="our-stories">While looking for hotels to stay for nights, we checked through <a class="our-stories-text-link" href="https://www.hotels.com/">Hotels.com</a> and, wow is that a
						convenient website and app! I highly recommend it, saved us every night through this trip, sleeping for less than 200,- NOK per person each night.</p>
						<p class="our-stories">After Copenhagen, we drove south, blazing through the Autobahn, before settling for the night in a hotel in a small village called Stemmen,
						southwest of Hamburg. It was good to see a bit of the countryside of Germany, and we also took some sidesteps going further south. The next night we slept in
						Koblenz, half an hour drive east of Nürburging, and went to see some historic places, among a fortress from old times.</p>
						<p class="our-stories">The next day we finally went for Nürburging, and after shopping a bit at the facilities around the track, we finally drove a lap. Our
						driver managed to tire out the brakes halfway so we had to drive carefully the rest. So after that, he booked a ride with a professional driver, which was
						really fun! Nürburging is a great tourist spot, for everyone in my opinion. I'm not very interested in cars, but it was a great ride nonetheless.</p>
						<p class="our-stories">After sleeping in Koblenz for another day, we started the long trip homewards... The first few hours we didn't find the Autobahn again,
						so we drove past many small villages and windmills. After blazing through Denmark and Sweden again (we didn't take a single ferry the whole trip), we finally
						arrived home in Sunnmøre after 23 hours and 45 minutes. The only time I slept, was 30 minutes before Stryn. I had never been so tired in my entire life...
						I slept for like 24 hours straight, so I lost all my snap streaks. But it was a great journey!</p>
